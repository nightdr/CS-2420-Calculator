# How to Run
To run this program you need to **save the Gradescope and Canvas html pages for the course** (push Ctrl+S while on each page).

After you have the pages downloaded, you can download the [zipped executable with dependencies](https://github.com/nightdr/CS-2420-Calculator/raw/master/executable/cs2420Calculator.zip) (fast but .exe in zip folder) or the [stand-alone executable](https://github.com/nightdr/CS-2420-Calculator/raw/master/executable/cs2420Calculator.exe) (slow but one file).

Once the program is run, it will ask for your Gradescope html file then for your Canvas html file. After getting your files, it will print your current weighted grade in the course and offer to calculate a final score necessary for a wanted grade.

Feel free to let me know about any questions or concerns on Piazza, enjoy!
